Brute Force Approach - this soultion will a for loop and we gonna traverse the array again again for finding the number which is one greater than 
                       previous number ( we can sort the array for better time complexity 

  Time Complexity :- O(n^3) if use the sorting it will be O(n log n);
  Space Complexity :- O(1);

 Optimal Approach - we are using set for the unique value and then finding one less value is present in the set or not and then finding the longest 
                    streak we have found in the set.

  class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        // Edge case: if the array is empty, no consecutive sequence exists
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
        // HashSet to store all elements for O(1) lookup
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        // Insert all numbers into the set
        for (int num : nums) {
            set.add(num);
        }
        // Variable to store the length of the longest consecutive sequence
        int longest = 0;
        // Iterate through each unique number in the set
        for (int num : set) {
            // We only start counting if num is the start of a sequence
            // i.e., num - 1 does NOT exist in the set
            if (!set.contains(num - 1)) {
                int currNum = num; // current number in the sequence
                int streak = 1;    // length of current consecutive sequence
                // Count consecutive numbers forward
                while (set.contains(currNum + 1)) {
                    currNum++;
                    streak++;
                }
                // Update the longest sequence found so far
                longest = Math.max(longest, streak);
            }
        }
        return longest;
    }
}
  Time Complexity :- O(n);
  Space Complexity :- O(n);
